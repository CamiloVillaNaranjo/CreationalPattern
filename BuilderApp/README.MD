# BuilderApp

In this project I embody the concepts learned in the **SOLID Design Patterns and Principles course**. The idea is to have a record of my progress in that course, for future reference.

Is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### About the Code
For this particular case, the notion of creating sandwiches is used, where the creation process involves adding items to form a final product (a Sandwich).
