# FactoryMethodApp

In this project I embody the concepts learned in the **SOLID Design Patterns and Principles course**. The idea is to have a record of my progress in that course, for future reference.

## Factory Method Pattern

Is a pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### About the code

In this case, I use the paradigm of creating Pizzas, becasue there is a some differences of pizza recipies, in the way that they baked and the Dough used, so thats why is not the same pizza in New York (NY), than Florida (FL)
