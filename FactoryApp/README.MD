# FactoryApp

In this project I embody the concepts learned in the **SOLID Design Patterns and Principles course**. The idea is to have a record of my progress in that course, for future reference.

## Factory Pattern

In this Pattern we create an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

### About the code

For this particular case, I have a folder: 
* **Employees**: Where we found an EmployeeFactory, which creates an Employee based on their role and and access boundary to the application
